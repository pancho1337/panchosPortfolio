          <p id="img-caption">I've loved Inca Flute music and its mix with cumbia that make an incredible fusion. It can be confusing; the style called Cumbia Andina is actually a Mexican spin-off from true Andean folkloric music. It is also different from, though similar to Chicha
            or Tinkus, which is pop/rock cumbia from the Andes. I love all of this music growing up in a comunity where this music flurished.</p>

              Original chants and melodies come from the general area inhabited by Quechuas (originally from Peru), Aymaras (originally from Bolivia), and other peoples who lived roughly in the area of the Inca Empire prior to European contact. This early music then
              was fused with Spanish music elements. It includes folklore music of parts of Northwest Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public
              in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The Nueva Canción movement of the 1970s revived the genre across Latin America and brought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten.
